# 3D-ATOMIC-ORBITAL-SIMULATION

#  Project Description

The main goal of this project is to visualize and simulate the structure of atomic orbitals that we have learnt in lower grades. 

#  project Usefulness

This project used for any one who wants to know about orbitals structure and it supports him/her by showing the 3d structure of orbitals this makes him/her to understand more about the orbitals structure rather than learning theoretically.
