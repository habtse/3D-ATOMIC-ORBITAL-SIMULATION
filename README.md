# 3D-ATOMIC-ORBITAL-SIMULATION

##  Description

The main goal of this project is to visualize and simulate the structure of atomic orbitals that we have learnt in lower grades. 

##  Usefulness

This project used for any one who wants to know about orbitals structure and it supports him/her by showing the 3d structure of orbitals this makes him/her to understand more about the orbitals structure rather than learning theoretically.
